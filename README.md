# SchedFix

A simple tool for making large changes to your calendars. Handy if you have a number of events with easily selectable titles that you would like to aler en masse.

##Current Status

Very rudimentary functionality, searches via string matching and applies changes.

##Next Steps

- Regex searching for event titles to allow for more refined edits
- Implement a selector for calendar selection, currently assumes user knows the exact title of the calendar they wish to target
